    Handlers always run in the order they are defined, not in the order listed in the notify-statement. This is also the case for handlers using listen.

    Handler names and listen topics live in a global namespace.

    Handler names are templatable and listen topics are not.

    Use unique handler names. If you trigger more than one handler with the same name, the first one(s) get overwritten. Only the last one defined will run.

    You can notify a handler defined inside a static include.

    You cannot notify a handler defined inside a dynamic include.
